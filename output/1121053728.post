		msg	GP supports the dissolution of Israel as a Jewish state. That is, they do not support ANY solution, two-state or otherwise, that would provide for Jewish self-determination there or anywhere else in the world, making them in favor of national aspirations of pretty much everyone as long as they're not Jews. While the GP may have good domestic ideas, they are rather isolationist in the tradition of Charles Lindbergh and keeping the US out of all wars, and like Lindbergh, the party is quite anti-Semitic (and has a long history of such nastiness) ... Ralph Nader being the most famous Jew-hater among them. 

Their proposed solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict would lead quite quickly to a bloody second Holocaust ... after which, I presume, Green Party supporters would cry copious crocodile tears and wring their hands about how the US can't possibly absorb so many millions of refugees (and "why should we let the Jews in first anyway, since there are already so many others? Let them wait their turn in line!").

		msg	Tried the quiz (inspired by your post). I came up 93% a Democrat, 93% a Green, and 78% a Socialist. This is a distinctly American take on the issues. How does a Canadian-Israeli-British-American get recognised as a Social Democrat. Don't you guys have such a category?
