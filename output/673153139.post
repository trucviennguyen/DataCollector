		msg	Just done my window ledges with this mixture as they are at floor level and are scratched by the dogs claws Impressive result although I had to find an alternate to Canola oil Rapeseed is the same according to the internet and I had some. Was pleased with the result went upstairs to vacuum to return to find Rory the Border Collie (Mad as a box of Adders) Licking the Window Sills He must have a thing about Vinegar Perhaps!!!

		msg	I'm not sure.  Some don't like his use of check collars etc, but I really like his understanding and use of dog psychology.  I suspect that if more people applied this to raising their puppies (and their children, for that matter!) there would be fewer problem dogs needing his management!

		msg	With Foxy I have applied Cesar's methods right from the beginning with the result that he is not afraid of anything, lightning, fireworks, other dogs etc. When he was little and their was an unusual new noise we would go back and investigate it so he would see there was nothing dangerous. I have some times looked after friends' dogs that the owners said were afraid of going into elevators or buses but after one or two attempts with Foxy acting as "Daddy" they would gladly climb either. I think it's the owners that scare their own dogs by showing their concern, don't you?
