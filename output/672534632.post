msg	Anna Crouch and Eric Crouch: maybe a useful antidote to your parents (and others). I particularly like the line "Do you really think your life has been so devoid of cares that you need to take up a pastime you dislike in order to teach yourself what adversity is?"

		msg	Once sat on a flight back to the UK with a dutchman on the way back home after some 25 years who had played with George Best at San Jose CA. Close as I got to fame, though I believe my mum lived near to Billy Cotton (wakey, wakey) as a kid. Though on second thoughts, maybe I'm ahead. Did I ever tell you that Alan Whicker was an old boy from my old school (which my brother got the free place to, but I was too thick so only got the assisted place -- chip the size of a King Edward).

Reminds me of my first ever hangover, 1976, when the Bubble Theatre had a performance the day after a night out with Bruce Eadie, which I had to attend with my mum in Hatch End (not the night out, but the one after).

		msg	Absolutely, that's what snail mail is for. Back in the day (2008) at the start of the Thousand Genomes Project, we used to send discs back and forth by courier between the UK and US. It was a lot cheaper and simpler than squirting it all down wires. Not sure if they still do it that way! Weirdly, I found myself sitting by my ex-colleague from that project, who I believe used to actually send the packages, on the train today.
