I guess given the Grandfather paradox, I couldn't actually do the deed myself (although from a direct moral perspective, I wouldn't have any problem, child Hitler or no).

		msg	Something really needed for that:  Ubiquitous ipv6.

The internet was designed for every endpoint to be potentially a server, and be reachable if it is on the internet.  The fact that most devices are hidden behind NAT, and have to do heroic non-trivial stuff to get work done balkanizes things - it divides the world into service-providers and consumers.

It's great if you're a service-provider, because any end-user application is going to have to go through you to be reachable from outside, so you have a choke point where you can monetize.  But it means anything involving user-hosted content needs some kind of tunnel to the outside, and that invites all sorts of abuse.

		id	10153804640120154_47389033
		msg	People have been trying to standardize the write-part ever since (webdav, etc.), and every attempt founders on the same problem:  versioning is hard, requires rich metadata and status responses much richer than "saved it" or "didn't save it".

Alas, people always either think that the full richness of versioning is too hard for users, so they do something dumbed-down, only to find that all the corner cases they thought they could ignore are important and happen routinely, so they've made something broken.

I'm figuring that at some point, someone is going to have an epiphany and realize that they already have the thing they need, to integrate into a browser to handle the "write" portion, and that thing is Git.

Wire it's auth mechanism up to WebID, provide a little more structure to the personal identity info, integrate a nice diff tool, and provide a way for editors for various content types to be plugged in - and you could actually *solve* that problem.  Attempt to agile your way around versioning and you just end up with another in a long line of things too limited to be useful.

		msg	Put it this way:  Say my data lives on a box in my house.  The power can go out, the house can burn down, etc.  Should I lose my data?  If I have a poor connection, should that data be what someone hits when they access data I make public?  Probably not.  So there needs to be some kind of replication out there;  and having a shared history both allows for that, provides a guarantee of integrity (you can interrorgate the history and its hashes, and hashes do not lie).

There is also data that multiple people can simultaneously edit, and you need a mechanism for reconciliation, which incorporates what parts of the data changed and information about who changed them and how.  If you have that at the level of raw data, it becomes a representation problem for how you present that to a user.

No semaphore will give you that.  If you try to make the problem simpler than it is, it will bite you, hard.

If you try to do read-write-web without this, you're just doomed to recapitulate the last 20 years of the history of developer tools, only to arrive at the same place - which seems like a rather silly use of peoples' time.

		msg	Tim Boudreau I think home-server can be stored online using archive servers like amazon glacier.  I also think that a distributed set of keys or distribution mechanisms will assist with the methodologies surrounding data-accessibility.  Not sure where the proxy method is upto yet, and certainly managing version control is perhaps another issue. 

The problem as i see it; revolves around the issue or 'knowledge banking'; that is, to improve the symmatry of rights, whether civil or democratic, or universal human types of rights; so that natural legal entities have similar if not greater rights than that of incorporated legal entities. 

To affect this opportunity, the ability for users to store, retrieve and interact with their data in a standardised and portable way is very necessary.  Risk management in incorporated entities do not worry about issues they do not feel threaten the revenue base of their organisations.  business systems engineers do not build systems that increase risk to organisations, and government is often reluctant to mandate requirements upon incorporated entities that threaten their ideas of employment drivers; yet, the mandate of identity and 'knowledge assets' outweighs the risk-variants of not providing such services to the people.  GFC's happen, because there is no identity and therefore, no accountability. Even BitCoin works extraordinarily well for producing coins, but not so well for producing wallets.  its not the crypto method that can be easily lost; just the personal association to that crypto 'asset'.

In-turn the problems start to relate to poor use of energy, poor valuations or indeed false valuations of objects, things, contributions of some and lack of contribution by others based entirely on the fact that there is little to no transparency as is perhaps described by the concept that the lay-person usually had no right to write.

		msg	Actually, they've been reading Keynes:

IN 1930, when the world was “suffering…from a bad attack of economic pessimism”, John Maynard Keynes wrote a broadly optimistic essay, “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren”. It imagined a middle way between revolution and stagnation that would leave the said grandchildren a great deal richer than their grandparents. But the path was not without dangers.

One of the worries Keynes admitted was a “new disease”: “technological unemployment…due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.” His readers might not have heard of the problem, he suggested—but they were certain to hear a lot more about it in the years to come.
